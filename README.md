# Ruby challenges and algorithms
A repo for all the ruby algorithms and challenges I solve.

## Of special interest
* [Binary Tree search algorithms] 
* [Merge sort](https://github.com/pugsiman/Ruby_challenges_and_algorithms/tree/master/Merge_Sort) (minimal and efficient code with recursion)
* [Fibonacci](https://github.com/pugsiman/Ruby_challenges_and_algorithms/tree/master/Fibonacci) (my take on fibonacci algorithms)
* [Enumerable methods](https://github.com/pugsiman/Ruby_challenges_and_algorithms/tree/master/Enumerable_Methods) (my take on common ruby methods)
