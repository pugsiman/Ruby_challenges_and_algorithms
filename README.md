# Ruby challenges and algorithms
A repo for all the ruby algorithms and challenges I solve.

## Of special interest
* [Binary Tree search algorithms](sbt.rb) (breadth and depth first search including recursively takes)
* [Merge sort](mergesort.rb) (minimal and efficient code with recursion)
* [Fibonacci](fibonacci.rb) (my take on fibonacci algorithms)
* [Enumerable methods](enumerable.rb) (my take on common ruby methods)
